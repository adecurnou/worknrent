# worknrent
A little calculator to show how many hours I need to work to prevent homelessness. 
Probably written in golang, just an exercise to see if I can do it. 

## Planned Features
- Ask for monthly rent
- Ask for hourly pay rate
- Ask for average tax rate

It should then return the amount of hours you need to work for that month, and how many 
hours for each week.
